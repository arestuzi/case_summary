Problem Statement
系统内存占用过高

Description
内存占用过高，并且不是由应用程序占用。需要手动使用“echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches”才能释放。

solution
通过您上传的sosreport，可以看出
cat /proc/meminfo
Slab:           26957208 kB
SReclaimable:   26896616 kB

slab占用了比较的内存， 但是同时可回收的slab值也很高，所以如果将要出现OOM现象时，操作系统会自动释放slab，取得相应的内存空间给新的进程。

导致slab高的原因，主要是因为文件名比较多， dentry cache是为了加快文件搜索而存在的一种缓存。通过echo 2 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches 会手动释放掉相应缓存。

What is dentry cache
The dentry cache (and any other slab cache for that matter) is free to grow to any size while there is free memory. It is simply making good use of available memory. When free memory is low the cache will be reclaimed on demand and the freed memory will be available for other purposes. Also when a filesystem is unmounted all of it's directory entries will be removed from the cache so unmounting is one workaround to help clear the cache. Only if the cache is not being reclaimed is there a problem and that may lead to memory starvation issues.

Interpreting /proc/meminfo and free output for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5, 6 and 7

RHEL 5, RHEL 6 and RHEL 7

    MemTotal: Total usable memory
    MemFree: The amount of physical memory not used by the system
    Buffers: Memory in buffer cache, so relatively temporary storage for raw disk blocks. This shouldn't get very large.
    Cached: Memory in the pagecache (Diskcache and Shared Memory)
    SwapCached: Memory that is present within main memory, but also in the swapfile. (If memory is needed this area does not need to be swapped out AGAIN because it is already in the swapfile. This saves I/O and increases performance if machine runs short on memory.)

RHEL 7 only

    MemAvailable: An estimate of how much memory is available for starting new applications, without swapping.

Detailed Level statistics
RHEL 5, RHEL 6 and RHEL 7

    Active: Memory that has been used more recently and usually not swapped out or reclaimed
    Inactive: Memory that has not been used recently and can be swapped out or reclaimed

RHEL 6 and RHEL 7 only

    Active(anon): Anonymous memory that has been used more recently and usually not swapped out
    Inactive(anon): Anonymous memory that has not been used recently and can be swapped out
    Active(file): Pagecache memory that has been used more recently and usually not reclaimed until needed
    Inactive(file): Pagecache memory that can be reclaimed without huge performance impact
    Unevictable: Unevictable pages can't be swapped out for a variety of reasons
    Mlocked: Pages locked to memory using the mlock() system call. Mlocked pages are also Unevictable.

Memory statistics
RHEL 5, RHEL 6 and RHEL 7

    SwapTotal: Total swap space available
    SwapFree: The remaining swap space available
    Dirty: Memory waiting to be written back to disk
    Writeback: Memory which is actively being written back to disk
    AnonPages: Non-file backed pages mapped into userspace page tables
    Mapped: Files which have been mmaped, such as libraries
    Slab: In-kernel data structures cache
    PageTables: Amount of memory dedicated to the lowest level of page tables. This can increase to a high value if a lot of processes are attached to the same shared memory segment.
    NFS_Unstable: NFS pages sent to the server, but not yet commited to the storage
    Bounce: Memory used for block device bounce buffers
    CommitLimit: Based on the overcommit ratio (vm.overcommit_ratio), this is the total amount of memory currently available to be allocated on the system. This limit is only adhered to if strict overcommit accounting is enabled (mode 2 in vm.overcommit_memory).
    Committed_AS: The amount of memory presently allocated on the system. The committed memory is a sum of all of the memory which has been allocated by processes, even if it has not been "used" by them as of yet.
    VmallocTotal: total size of vmalloc memory area
    VmallocUsed: amount of vmalloc area which is used
    VmallocChunk: largest contiguous block of vmalloc area which is free
    HugePages_Total: Number of hugepages being allocated by the kernel (Defined with vm.nr_hugepages)
    HugePages_Free: The number of hugepages not being allocated by a process
    HugePages_Rsvd: The number of hugepages for which a commitment to allocate from the pool has been made, but no allocation has yet been made.
    Hugepagesize: The size of a hugepage (usually 2MB on an Intel based system)

RHEL 6 and RHEL 7 only

    Shmem: Total used shared memory (shared between several processes, thus including RAM disks, SYS-V-IPC and BSD like SHMEM)
    SReclaimable: The part of the Slab that might be reclaimed (such as caches)
    SUnreclaim: The part of the Slab that can't be reclaimed under memory pressure
    KernelStack: The memory the kernel stack uses. This is not reclaimable.
    WritebackTmp: Memory used by FUSE for temporary writeback buffers
    HardwareCorrupted: The amount of RAM the kernel identified as corrupted / not working
    AnonHugePages: Non-file backed huge pages mapped into userspace page tables
    HugePages_Surp: The number of hugepages in the pool above the value in vm.nr_hugepages. The maximum number of surplus hugepages is controlled by vm.nr_overcommit_hugepages.
    DirectMap4k: The amount of memory being mapped to standard 4k pages
    DirectMap2M: The amount of memory being mapped to hugepages (usually 2MB in size)
