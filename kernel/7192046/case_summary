Description
Redhat 5.x和6.x 的max number of processes 默认是多少,如何修改。

Solution
The pid number is allocated from the kernel. By default the pid_max value in RHEL5 is 32768. On RHEL6, the default pid_max value will depend on the number of CPUs available, it'll be the result of the following calculation:

pid_max = min(pid_max_max, max_t(int, pid_max, PIDS_PER_CPU_DEFAULT * num_possible_cpus()))

Which with RHEL6 kernel config translates to:

On 32 bit kernel: pid_max = min(32768, max(32768, 1024 * (number of CPUs))) = 32768
On 64 bit kernel: pid_max = min(4194304, max(32768, 1024 * (number of CPUs)))

On 32 bit kernels, the maximum value allowed for pid_max is 32768. On 64 bit kernels, it is 4194304 (=4 * 1024 * 1024).

But it is recommended that any value which exceeds a 128K footprint should be avoided. A pid_max of 1 million causes a 128K footprint. So theoretically half million is an acceptable value.

For user space application, the minimal pid start from 300.

It is always advisable to check it thoroughly in a test environment as per the requirement.

It depends on server resources and also the application which requires the pid_max to be increased. An example for simple testing is given below.

1. Modify the pid_max value to 50000.

[root@test root]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
32768

[root@test root]# echo 50000 > /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max

or

[root@test root]# sysctl -w kernel.pid_max=50000

[root@test root]# cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max
50000
